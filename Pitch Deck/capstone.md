Introduction
========================================================

The goal of the Data Science Capstone Project from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhsph.edu/) (JHU) is
to create a usable application on natural language processing. This capstone project
is offered in collaboration with [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en).

The objective of the project is to build a functioning predictive text model. 
The data is from a corpus called 
[HC Corpora](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20160930083655/http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/aboutcorpus.html), and,
for this application, only the english datasets have been utilized.

For this project, the Text Mining packages **tm** and **text2vec** were used, along with the data manipulation
package **dplyr** and the package **doParallel**. The app was created using the **shiny** package.


Predictive Model
========================================================

To build the predictive model, 1.000.000 lines from all twitter, blogs and news datasets were sampled. The sample
dataset was then cleaned, by removing all non-ascii characters, like emoji, being converted to lowercase letters and then
by removing all contractions, punctuation, numbers, profanities, leftout letters and extra whitespaces.

The data was then tokenized to form **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE) matrices of various n-grams. For the sake of accuracy, all frequencies up to 6-grams were computed.

Finally, the top 3 predictions, using a simple back-off model, are being calculated as predictions to the user input. The reason for having 3 predictions instead of 1 is that the accuracy *the user experiences* is substantially increased.


The Shiny Application
========================================================

You can find the application [here](https://sigm4.shinyapps.io/Capstone_Prediction/). Below is an image of the UI.

Each of the 3 predicted words is **clickable**, and when clicked the respective word is being added to the input text.  
The application provides a prediction almost instantly.
